# How It Works

Agro Predict is a decentralized prediction market that allows users to forecast agricultural outcomes using blockchain and oracle systems. Here’s the step-by-step workflow:

## Step 1: Market Creation
- Admins or verified creators deploy prediction markets via `MarketFactory.sol`.
- Each market represents an agricultural event (e.g., rainfall, crop yield, commodity price).

## Step 2: User Participation
- Users stake **APM tokens** to submit predictions.
- Users select outcomes for specific markets.

## Step 3: Oracle Resolution
- Trusted oracles provide real-world results.
- Results are submitted on-chain and verified automatically.

## Step 4: Rewards Distribution
- Users with accurate predictions receive **APM token payouts**.
- Payouts are proportional to prediction accuracy and stake size.

## Step 5: Continuous Market Lifecycle
- New markets are created weekly or based on seasonal events.
- Data is collected continuously for analytics and improving prediction accuracy.

**Core Benefits of the Workflow**
- Transparent prediction process  
- Incentivized accuracy  
- Immutable on-chain records  
- Community-driven ecosystem
